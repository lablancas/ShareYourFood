Notes from Google AngularJS Best Practices:
	Components are common elements reused elsewhere in the app

	Components:
	  > A components directory contains directives, services, filters, and related files.
	  > Common data (images, models, utility files, etc.) might also live under components (e.g. components/lib/), or it can be stored externally.
	  > Components can have subcomponent directories, including appended naming where possible.
	  > Components may contain module definitions, if appropriate. (See "Module definitions" below.)

 
Notes from Lucas:
	This folder is used for directives, services, and filters.

	Directives can include html and css if being used to define the directive.

	Create a folder for each group of directives, services, and filters.
	  > Each folder can also have only directives, services, or filters
	  > Each directive, service, filter should be accompanied with a test
  
Example:

	components/
		foo/ -- directive without html and css
			foo-directives.js
			foo-directives_test.js
		foo2/ -- directive without html and css
			foo2-directives.js
			foo2-directives_test.js
			foo2.html
			foo2.css
		bar/ -- services and filters in the same component
			bar-services.js
			bar-services_test.js
			bar-filters.js
			bar-filters.js
